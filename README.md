# Trade Tracker
A WPF desktop app desgined to demonstrate simple .NET WPF skills with some SQL database connection.

The application allows users (e.g., traders) to _view, add, edit, and delete_ trade records stored in a _local SQL database_. This simulates a simplified version of a trading system UI and demonstrates key skills: **WPF layout, MVVM, EF Core, data binding, and basic unit testing**.
